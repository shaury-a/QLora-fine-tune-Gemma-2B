# Fine-Tuning Gemma-2B with QLoRA 

This repository contains scripts for fine-tuning and inference using the Gemma-2B model so that based on user question and context, the model first generates a rationale which it will use to answer the user question. The fine-tuning process uses the QLoRA technique to adapt the model for a custom dataset.

## Features

- **Fine-Tuning with LoRA:** Efficient adaptation of the Gemma-2B model using QLoRA.
- **Inference and Evaluation:** Scripts to evaluate the fine-tuned model on a custom dataset.
- **FInal Result:** This file contains results for fine-tuned and base model.
